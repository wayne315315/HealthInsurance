Step 1. Goal setting
- Predict annual health cost on any given individual
- Evaluation metrics on test set
	- Coefficient of determination (r2)
	- Mean absolute error (mae)
	- Mean squared error (mse)

Step 2. Data cleaning
- Eliminate meaningless features
- Repair or eliminate imcomplete records

Step 3. Descriptive statistics
- Box plot for each numerical feature to obtain mean, variance and to detect outliers
- Bar chart for each categorical feature to detect rare events

Step 3b. Subgroup analysis for outliers  (Optional)

Step 4. Data transformation
- Normalize data to prevent neural node saturation
- 

Step 5. Model selection
- Fully connected feedforward network
- Consider common low level feature layers in different catergorical product(i.e lifelong learning)
